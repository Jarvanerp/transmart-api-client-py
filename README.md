The tranSMART API Training given on [2015 tranSMART Foundation Annual Meeting in Amsterdam](http://transmartfoundation.org/2015-annual-meeting/)

The python client created for that project has now been recovered to work with version 2 of the tranSMART API. 

This is meant to work with Python 3.x only.
